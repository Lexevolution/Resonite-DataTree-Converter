# Resonite DataTree Converter

This Windows tool allows you to convert any Resonite DataTree object file (.brson, .7zbson, .lz4bson) to JSON and vice-versa.

This tool uses Resonite's libraries to convert them, so it sohuld hopefully work for the forseeable future. This tool saves the location that you selected for Resonite in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Lexevolution/Resonite DataTree Converter/app.config`.
